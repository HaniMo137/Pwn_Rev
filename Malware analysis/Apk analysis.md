### The manifest :
- first thing to do ofc is to read the manifest and search for suspicious things, and it was overwhelming and screaming hey i m watching ur device and stalking .
- this manifest screams **Android spyware / RAT**. Key tells:

- **Full surveillance stack:** `CAMERA`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `ACCESS_FINE/COARSE_LOCATION`, plus **screen-capture** vibes (`mediaProjection`, `RequestScreenCap`).
    
- **Data theft:** `READ_SMS`/`SEND_SMS` (OTP grab + SMS relay), `READ_CALL_LOG`, `READ_CONTACTS`, `GET_ACCOUNTS`, `READ_PHONE_STATE`.
    
- **Account takeover / UI hijack:** `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` (priority 999) + `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (overlay/phish) + `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`.
    
- **Keylogging:** `BIND_INPUT_METHOD` with a service labeled **“Simple Keyboard”** = classic IME keylogger disguise.
    
- **Traffic interception:** `BIND_VPN_SERVICE` (“FirewallServices”) = local VPN MITM-style control (at least traffic routing/visibility).
    
- **Persistence + anti-removal:** `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`, foreground services, plus **Device Admin** (`BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN`).
    
- **Dropper/installer behavior:** `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` + `REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES` + package change receivers.
    
- **Masquerading:** app label/activities like **“Blockchain”**, **“Play Store”**, **“Settings”**, many `excludeFromRecents`, translucent themes.
    
- **Targeting social apps:** `queries` for WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook (`com.orca`, `com.katana`, `com.lite`, `com.instagram...`, WhatsApp OTP/payment intents) → consistent with credential/OTP harvesting.
    
- **Heavy obfuscation:** long random package/class names + weird metadata = packer/templated builder signature.
    

So: not just “broadcast” UI strings — this is a **multi-capability spyware framework** (surveil + steal + persist + overlay/Accessibility).

### apktool.yml ;
- **apkFileName** is just the sample’s hash-style filename (not developer info).
    
- **minSdkVersion: 21** → runs on **Android 5.0+**.
    
- **targetSdkVersion: 29** → claims modern compatibility up to **Android 10** behavior-wise.
    
- **forcedPackageId: 127 (0x7f)** → _normal_ Android resource package ID, not suspicious by itself.
    
- **doNotCompress: resources.arsc / png / jpg** → common; keeps resources readable/fast, nothing special.
    
- **versionCode: 3573638** (huge) + **versionName: 5.0.0.0** → often seen in repack/builder-generated apps; doesn’t prove malware, but fits “mass-produced” tooling.
    
- **apktool version 2.7.0-dirty** → just the tool build state on _your_ side (not from the APK).
### Suspicious strings : 
- spywarefantasydums272 i did research based on this and what i found is Researchers at Zimperium identified Fantasy Hub, a new Android spyware developed and sold as a subscription on Russian-language cybercrime forums. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) means cybercriminals rent out to malware to other criminals, complete with the infrastructure necessary to harvest and abuse stolen information. Usually, it’s up to the buyer to spread the malware, but Fantasy Hub goes a step further—it comes with full documentation, video tutorials, and a subscription model that makes it easy for even inexperienced attackers to use. Its creators provide step-by-step guides to create fake Google Play pages that imitate apps like Telegram or online banking portals, complete with realistic reviews. It’s a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that anyone can distribute. Distribution relies heavily on social engineering and phishing. Attackers use Fantasy Hub’s templates and tools to set up convincing fake app pages, tricking users into downloading the malicious software. A “dropper” option even lets buyers upload any Android app APK and get back a modified version with Fantasy Hub added. These counterfeit apps look legitimate, and often request only a single permission: SMS access. But that permission unlocks much more. The SMS handler role bundles multiple powerful permissions: contacts, camera, and file access into a single authorization step, unlocking extensive control over the device’s messaging, contacts, and camera functions. Fantasy Hub is designed to bypass standard security checks and can remain concealed, making detection difficult for users. so basically it s the same behavior i concluded from strings that it's a spymalware faking a blockchain app and using social engineering techniques to retrieve info and priviliges
- - **Manifest permissions** line up with a RAT/spyware feature set: `READ_SMS/SEND_SMS`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `CAMERA`, `ACCESS_FINE/COARSE_LOCATION`, `READ_CONTACTS`, `READ_CALL_LOG`, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, plus **battery-optimization bypass** and install/delete package requests. That’s basically “I want persistence + surveillance + UI abuse + data theft”.
    
- **Social engineering / masquerading** is consistent:
    
    - App label/icon pretending to be “Blockchain”, “System Keyboard”, “Settings”, “Play Store”.
        
    - Device-admin receiver (`BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN`) + strings like “Allow … for device admin” → classic coercion flow.
        
    - `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` + `AccessibilityService` → overlays + auto-click/credential theft + permission granting.
        
- **Persistence & stealth**: Boot receivers, foreground services, “excludeFromRecents”, translucent no-title-bar activities, “FloatingView”, “Over” activities → typical “hide UI, run always”.
    
- **Targeting/abuse surface**:
    
    - `queries` includes lots of security manager packages (MIUI/Huawei/Oppo/Vivo/etc.) → often used to open settings pages, request whitelisting, or evade OEM restrictions.
        
    - WhatsApp/Messenger/Instagram package references → either targeting comms apps or used as lures.
        
- **“broadcast” string**: not necessarily networking broadcast; in your strings dump it looks like _messenger-style_ “broadcast list” wording. That fits the “repacked messaging app template” vibe, or reuse of WhatsApp/Meta UI text as camouflage.
    

So: based on _your static evidence_, it’s totally reasonable to classify it as **Android spyware/RAT masquerading as a Blockchain app, using social engineering to get admin/accessibility/overlay, then doing surveillance + data theft with persistence**.


-  I checked the raw dict and found an empty file discountc69
An **empty `res/raw/discountc69`** usually means “this APK doesn’t ship the juicy blob _there_”.

Most likely interpretations:

- **Placeholder resource ID**: dev wants a stable `R.raw.discount69` handle (for `getIdentifier()` / `openRawResource()`), but the content is irrelevant. The _name_ is what matters.
    
- **Trigger for fallback behavior**: code tries to read it; if length==0 → switch to **network fetch / staged payload / remote config** (common in droppers).
    
- **Decoy / noise**: matches the same obfuscation pattern as `breakfastu56`, `trademarks59`, etc. (`word+number`), so it may just be entropy to waste analyst time.
### Original AndroidManifest :
i found another manifest inside original dict and this is what i observed
Key signals:

- **Privilege escalation + control**
    
    - `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` → full UI automation (reads screen, clicks, steals creds/OTP flows).
        
    - `BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN` (`DEVICE_ADMIN_ENABLED`) → persistence + harder uninstall/lockscreen tricks.
        
    - `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` + `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` + `showWhenLocked/turnScreenOn` → overlay/phishing on top of real apps + force prompts.
        
- **Data theft surface is huge**
    
    - `READ_SMS/SEND_SMS` (OTP interception + premium/SMS exfil).
        
    - `READ_CONTACTS/GET_ACCOUNTS` (identity graph).
        
    - `READ_CALL_LOG/READ_PHONE_STATE` (tracking/IMSI-ish signals).
        
    - `RECORD_AUDIO/CAMERA` (mic/cam spying).
        
    - `ACCESS_FINE/COARSE_LOCATION` + Maps meta-data → live tracking.
        
- **Persistence + stealth UX**
    
    - `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` + many boot actions → auto-start after reboot.
        
    - `excludeFromRecents`, weird `taskAffinity app.one/app.two` → hide activities / isolate tasks.
        
    - Lots of **exported** “Request*” activities (Admin/VPN/ScreenCap/Keyboard) → permission-harvesting UI.
        
- **Traffic control / MITM-ish capability**
    
    - `BIND_VPN_SERVICE` (`VpnService`) + “FirewallServices” → can tunnel/observe/block traffic.
        
    - `usesCleartextTraffic="true"` → happy to talk HTTP (bad sign).
        
- **Keylogging angle**
    
    - `BIND_INPUT_METHOD` + `KeyboardService` and app name **“System Keyboard / Simple Keyboard”** → classic IME keylogger disguise.
        
- **Targeting social apps**
    
    - `queries` includes WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook Messenger (`com.orca`, `com.katana`, `com.lite`, `com.instagram.*`) → detects/targets installed apps.
        

Overall: this is **multi-vector spyware** (accessibility + admin + IME + overlay + VPN) with a UI designed to **social-engineer permissions** — consistent with MaaS-style Android RAT behavior.

## Deep in rabbit hole : 
i was moving around the smali files to see if they re normal or very suspicious but results was very interesting , files and dicts with random names, ones asking for privilige , record etc
**Big red flags (what these names usually mean):**

- `Binance.smali`, `Okex.smali`, `Trust.smali` (+ `MyWebView`, `AndroidInterface`, `MyWebChromeClient`) → **fake exchange wallets / WebView phishing** + JS bridge for stealing inputs.
    
- `FloatingView.smali` → **overlay / screen popups** (classic credential harvesting UI).
    
- `lrnkvbku.../AccessService.smali`, `PerformGesture*`, `ExecClick`, `ClickUnlock*`, `OppoUnlock*` → **Accessibility abuse** (auto-click, UI automation, bypass prompts).
    
- `RequestAdmin.smali` → **device admin social-engineering**.
    
- `RequestVPN.smali` → **traffic hijack / monitoring / persistence tricks**.
    
- `RequestKeyboard*.smali` + `KeyboardService` (in that lrnkvbku… folder) → **IME keylogging / input capture**.
    
- `RecordPayPass*.smali` → straight-up **payment PIN / pass capture**.
    
- `RecordScreen* / HandleScreenCap` → **screen capture / recording**.
    
- `BootReceiver`, `ScreenReceiver`, `PackagesReceiver` → **persistence + event-based triggers**.

We basically confirmed this APK is a **trojanized “Blockchain / System Keyboard” fake app that behaves like an Android spyware/RAT**, matching the **Fantasy Hub** style: heavy **social-engineering** to push the victim into granting **Device Admin + Accessibility + “Install unknown apps” + overlay** permissions, then it gains persistence via **BOOT/SCREEN/REBOOT receivers**, hides behind legit-looking UI strings, and uses services like **AccessibilityService/keyboard + floating overlay/WebView** to automate clicks, capture inputs, and potentially phish credentials (fake pages / embedded web flows). The manifest and smali layout show the core modules: **RequestAdmin**, **RequestKeyboard**, **RequestScreenCap**, **RequestVPN**, **FloatingView/WebView chrome client**, **RecordScreen/ScreenCap handlers**, plus broad permissions (SMS, contacts, call logs, mic, camera, storage, network, wake lock, foreground service) — all classic “full control” spyware plumbing. The resources are also telling: tons of obfuscated strings + a “spyware…” marker, and only a useless/empty raw file (`discount69`), suggesting payload/config is likely fetched remotely or generated at runtime rather than shipped plainly in `res/raw`. So deliverable-wise: **type = Android Spyware/RAT (MaaS)**, **name/family attribution = Fantasy Hub (per your research + indicators)**, **method = phishing/fake store pages + permission coercion**, **capabilities inferred = device takeover via accessibility/overlay, data harvesting, persistence, possible screen/credential capture**.
