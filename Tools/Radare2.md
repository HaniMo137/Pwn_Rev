radare2 (r2) is an **interactive reverse-engineering framework** for binaries (ELF/PE/Mach-O): disassembly, analysis, debugging, patching, and scripting.
##### Core pieces :
- [[R2]]: interactive RE shell (disasm, graph, xrefs, decompile-ish via plugins)

- [[Rabin2]] : inspect binary (info, symbols, imports, strings, sections, relocs)

- [[Radiff2]]: diff binaries/patches (byte + code diffs)

- [[Rasm2]]: assemble/disassemble opcodes

- [[Rahash2]]: hashes/checksums

- [[Rax2]]: number/base conversions + quick math

- [[Ragg2]] : shellcode/ testcode generator (CTF utility)
