# My Reverse Engineering \& Binary Exploitation Vault



This vault is a collection of personal notes and resources focused on my journey in **reverse engineering**, **binary exploitation**, and **capture the flag (CTF)** challenges. It includes:



- Malware analysis reports

- Known exploits and vulnerabilities

- Personal notes from various reverse engineering exercises

- Writeups from CTF challenges

- Links for learning and training resources



The vault will be continuously updated as I progress in these fields.



## Goals

- Improve my skills in reverse engineering and binary exploitation

- Track and document my learning progress

- Build a comprehensive resource for personal reference and sharing
