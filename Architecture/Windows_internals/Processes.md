Each _process_ provides the resources needed to execute a program.
A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. 
Each process is started with a single thread, often called the _primary thread_, but can create additional threads from any of its [[Threads]].
