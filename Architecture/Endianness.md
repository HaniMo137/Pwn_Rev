[Computer memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) consists of a sequence of storage cells (smallest [addressable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space") units); in machines that support [byte addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_addressing "Byte addressing"), those units are called _[bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte")_. Each byte is identified and accessed in hardware and software by its [memory address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address"). If the total number of bytes in memory is _n_, then addresses are enumerated from 0 to _n_ − 1.
