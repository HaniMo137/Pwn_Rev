The basis of ROP is chaining together small chunks of code already exists within the binary itself in such a way to harm the system. The idea often involves passing parameters to functions already present within [[Libc]] , such as `system`  -  if you can find the location of a command, such as `cat flag.txt`, and then pass it _as a parameter_ to `system`, it will execute that command and return the output.
