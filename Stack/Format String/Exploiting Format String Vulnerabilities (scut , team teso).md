### Buffer Overflow vs Format String Vulnerability :
Buffer Overflow : old , large nb of exploits , security threat , hard to spot sometimes.
Format String : new compared to b.over , less number of exploits , programming bug , easy to find.

### Format Function :
A **format function** refers to any function that converts or manipulates data (often strings) into a specific format, usually for display, storage, or transmission.
- **Formatting strings**: Changing how data is represented, like numbers or dates, by specifying a format pattern (e.g., adding leading zeros or specific decimal places).
- **Output formatting**: Inserting values into placeholders in a template string (e.g., `printf` or `sprintf` in C).

### Vulnerability? 
If an attacker is able to provide the format string to an ANSI C format function in part or as a whole, a format string vulnerability is present. By doing so, the behavior of the format function is changed, and the attacker may get control over the target application.
Vuln example : (no format is specified for the user string )
```C
int func (char *user) { printf (user); }
```

### Format Function Family :

#### - Real Family members :
- fprintf — prints to a FILE stream
- printf — prints to the ‘stdout’ stream
- sprintf — prints into a string
- snprintf — prints into a string with length checking
- vfprintf — print to a FILE stream from a va_arg structure
- vprintf — prints to ‘stdout’ from a va_arg structure
- vsprintf — prints to a string from a va_arg structure
- vsnprintf — prints to a string with length checking from a va_arg structure
#### - Relatives :
- setproctitle — set argv[]
- syslog — output to the syslog facility
- others like err*, verr*, warn*, vwarn*
